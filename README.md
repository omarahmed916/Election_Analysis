## Summary
This script can be  modified to fit any type of election. For example, if you wanted to analyze a national election, all you need to do is change the counties to states. Also, if you had local bill elections, you could change the script from "candidates" to "in favor" and "against". There are many ways to adapt and utilize this script after having the foundation set.
